==Install==
For astravault to run, you need python 2.x, astravault will probably not run with python 3.x.  To check if it is on your machine, in a terminal type:

python

If python 2.x is not on your machine, download the latest python 2.x, which is available from:

http://www.python.org/download/

You will also need OpenSSL.  To check if it is on your machine, type:

openssl

If it is not on your machine, the openssl home page is at:

http://www.openssl.org/

===Help===
Then in a terminal, type:
python astravault.py -h

Which will bring up the documentation.  The documentation is also at the top of the astravault.py file.
